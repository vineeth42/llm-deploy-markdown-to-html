# Markdown â†’ HTML Viewer (marked)

## Summary
This project is a minimal, self-contained web application that converts a Markdown file (input.md) into HTML and renders it in the browser using a bundled, marked-compatible parser (no network requests or build tools required). If an input.md file is not present next to index.html, the app gracefully falls back to an embedded example (provided via attachments) so you can see the renderer in action immediately.

Key characteristics:
- Self-contained: ships as static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) with no external CDN dependencies.
- Marked-style API: the renderer is exposed via window.marked.parse(md) for familiarity and easy adaptation.
- Progressive loading: attempts to fetch input.md and falls back to embedded content if unavailable.
- Accessible and responsive UI with a source view toggle.

## Setup
No build steps are necessary.

1. Download the repository files (index.html, style.css, script.js, README.md).
2. Optionally place your own input.md file alongside index.html.
3. Open index.html in your web browser.

The app will try to load input.md from the same directory. If that file does not exist, it renders the embedded example content.

## Usage
- Open index.html in any modern browser.
- Click "Reload input.md" to re-fetch the file from disk (useful after edits).
- Click "Toggle source" to show/hide the raw Markdown next to the rendered HTML.
- To render your own Markdown:
  - Add or replace the input.md file in the same directory.
  - Press the Reload button or refresh the page.

Notes:
- Security: The renderer escapes raw HTML by default and supports common Markdown features (headings, lists, emphasis, links, images, code blocks, etc.).
- Offline-friendly: All logic is local; no external network requests are required.
